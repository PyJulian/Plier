Compile Python to a MacOS app

Compile the code by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript_Editor" target="_blank">ScriptEditor App</a> made by Apple
Or <a href="https://wortelarchief.netlify.app/css/plier.zip">Download Plier</a> pre compiled :)

If you have suggestions email me > **wortelarchief@gmail.com**

### How does plier work
It creates a few folders, contents resources blah blah.
creates info.plist and the main executable.
cxmods smth idk but makes the main executable execute
the executable is shell running python3 so python3 must be preinstalled lol.

### Can I commit?
Yeah just credit me.
